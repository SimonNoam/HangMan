Hang Man UWP C#

This is a simple implementation of the classic game Hang Man for the Universal Windows Platform (UWP) using C#.
Installation

How to Play

The objective of the game is to correctly guess the word that is being displayed by correctly guessing the letters that make up the word. You have 6 incorrect guesses before you lose the game.

To start a new game, click on the "New Game" button. A word will be displayed with underscores representing the letters that you need to guess.

To make a guess, type in a letter and click the "Guess" button. If the letter is in the word, it will be revealed in the appropriate place. If the letter is not in the word, you will lose one of your incorrect guesses.

The game is won when you correctly guess all of the letters in the word, and is lost when you run out of incorrect guesses.
